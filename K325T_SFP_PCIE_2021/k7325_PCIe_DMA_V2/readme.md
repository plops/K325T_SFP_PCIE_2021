Based on the provided files, here's a summary of the "PCIE_DMA_Demo" project:

**Project Overview:**

* This project targets the Xilinx Kintex-7 XC7K325T FPGA and involves PCIe communication with Direct Memory Access (DMA) functionality.
* The project is designed in VHDL and uses Vivado 2019.1 for implementation.

**Key Components:**

* **PCIe Endpoint (EP):** The project includes a PCIe endpoint core ("pcie_k7_gen2x4"), likely implemented using a Xilinx IP core. 
* **DMA Engine:** The project implements a DMA engine, represented by the "riffa" modules in the source files. This engine likely handles data transfers between the PCIe endpoint and the FPGA's internal memory.
* **Channel Tester:**  The "chnl_tester" module is likely designed to test the DMA channel functionality, simulating data transfers and verifying correct operation.

**Hardware Setup:**

* **Clocking:**
    * The project uses a 100MHz reference clock ("pcie_ref_clk") for the PCIe core.
    * There are also internal clocks generated for different parts of the design, such as 125MHz and 250MHz clocks ("clk_125mhz_x0y0", "clk_250mhz_x0y0").
* **Pin Assignments:**
    * The constraints file ("pcie_7k325.xdc") defines pin locations for PCIe signals, the system reset ("sys_rst_n"), a link-up indicator ("link_up"), and a debug LED ("Dbg_LED").
    * The PCIe lanes are assigned to specific GTXE2 transceiver channels in the FPGA.
* **Configuration:** The project uses a SPI flash memory for storing the FPGA configuration bitstream. It's configured for a 4-bit SPI bus and a configuration rate of 50. 

**Project Structure:**

* The project is organized into several source files, including separate modules for the DMA engine, PCIe core, and channel tester.
* The Vivado project file ("PCIE_DMA_Demo.xpr") manages the build process and includes information about the target device, design files, constraints, and simulation settings.

**Further Analysis:**

* To understand the DMA engine's specific functionality, you'll need to analyze the "riffa" modules in detail. These modules likely implement features like scatter-gather DMA, memory address translation, and flow control.
* Examining the "Example_Top.vhd" file (which is missing from the provided list) would give a clear picture of how the different components are interconnected and how the DMA engine is integrated into the overall system.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Locate Example_Top.vhd:**  It's essential to find the top-level design file to see how the components are wired together. 
2. **Analyze "riffa" Modules:**  Study the individual "riffa" modules to understand the DMA engine's implementation details.
3. **Examine PCIe IP Core:**  If possible, explore the configuration settings of the PCIe endpoint core ("pcie_k7_gen2x4") to understand its specific features and capabilities.

Once you have more information about these aspects, you'll be able to gain a deeper understanding of the project's DMA operations and PCIe communication flow.
