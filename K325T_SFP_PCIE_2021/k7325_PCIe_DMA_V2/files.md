Based on your input, here's a list of files likely to be important for understanding the project, focusing on those under 200kB:

**Project Configuration & Structure:**

* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.xpr (42kB):**  The main Vivado project file.  This is essential for opening the project in the Vivado IDE.
* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.hw/hw_1/hw.xml (2kB):** Describes the hardware platform for the project.
* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.src/system.xdc (7kB):**  Top-level constraints file, likely defining pin assignments, clocking, and other physical constraints. 
* **./.Xil/Example_Top_propImpl.xdc (1kB):**  Xilinx Design Constraints file for the 'Example_Top' module (after implementation).  May contain timing constraints.
* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.hw/PCIE_DMA_Demo.lpr (343B):**  Project file, potentially for a different tool or part of the build process.

**Top-Level Design:**

* **./Example_Top.vhd (8kB):**  Likely the top-level VHDL design file for your project. This is a good starting point to understand the project's architecture.
* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.src/pcie_7k325.xdc (7kB):** Constraints specifically for the  XC7K325T FPGA, suggesting this is the target device.
* **./PCIE_DMA_Demo.src/chnl_tester.vhd (4kB):** This file seems to contain code for testing a channel, potentially related to the DMA functionality.

**Important Notes:**

* **Large Files:** The list you provided includes many large files (e.g., .dcp, .vhdl, .v). While these contain implementation details, you usually don't need to examine them directly to grasp the project's fundamentals.
* **Focus on Top-Level:** Start by analyzing the top-level design files (Example_Top.vhd, system.xdc, pcie_7k325.xdc).  They provide a high-level view. 
* **Project Documentation:**  Always look for any README files, comments within the code, or external documentation that the project creators might have included.
